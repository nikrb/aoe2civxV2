An AOE2:DE civ comparison app

This app shows units and techs available to a civ. The view is similar to the game screen tech tree.

# why

This is for noobs like me who are unfamiliar with the civs. At the start of a game you can create a side-by-side view on your own and your opponents civs.

The app will show up to 8 civs, for a 4 by 4 game, though I'm not sure how useful this is.

# how

Just clone the repo, run npm install and npm run dev then connect from a browser.

# Acknowledgements

This app would not be possible without the data collected and kept up to date from the [seige engineers](https://siegeengineers.org/)
